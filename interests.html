                        <p>Game design is something that's interested me for a long time. I grew up playing games in my spare time, it was one of my favorite pastimes... My best friend and I would spend a ridiculous amount of time playing Halo, but not for the main draws like the campaign or the versus multiplayer. We would play it for the forge mode. A mode where you could make your own maps and gamemodes. We hardly ever played much of the maps we made, we would just create them and talk about how they would played. That was good enough for us. However, all that time playing forge piqued my interest. What makes a game good? Better yet, how do you even begin to make one?</p>
                        <p>Here are two channels I find interesting that covers games/game design:</p>

                        <h2 id="programming">Programming</h2>
                        <p>Programming is something I've only recently started to delve into. My interest in it was sparked by my desire to learn to make games. Though I'm just a beginner now and I have a lot to learn. I've been learning a lot about HTML and CSS to make this webpage, but I started learning the basics of programming in Java before moving on to C# as part of the Computer Science program at my college. There's so much I have to learn, but I'm glad to have gotten started, because I've got a long road ahead of me.</p>
                        <p>Here are two resources that have helped me while learning programming:</p>
                        <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/" target="_blank">Stack Overflow</a>
                        <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">W3 Schools</a>

                </div>

                <div class="interest">
                    <div>
                        <h2 id="historicalfigures">Historical Figures</h2>
                        <p>This is more of a recent interest of mine that was sparked by my grandpa giving me a bunch of biographies that he had read. I've never been much of an avid reader, but I figured I would try it out. So I started reading the biography of the Wright brothers. I remembered learning a tiny bit about them in school and figured it might be interesting. I think it gave interesting insight into the times as well. There was so much interest in flight at the time, but so many failed attempts led people to believe nothing would come of it.</p>
                        <p>Here are some other major figures involved in early aviation:</p>
