                    <p>Game design is something that's interested me for a long time. I grew up playing games in my spare time, it was one of my favorite pastimes... My best friend and I would spend a ridiculous amount of time playing Halo, but not for the main draws like the campaign or the versus multiplayer. We would play it for the forge mode. A mode where you could make your own maps and gamemodes. We hardly ever played much of the maps we made, we would just create them and talk about how they would played. That was good enough for us. However, all that time playing forge piqued my interest. What makes a game good? Better yet, how do you even begin to make one? I could spend all this time thinking about making one, but the main thing I would need to get started is the ability to program.</p>

                    <p>Programming is something I've only recently started to delve into. My interest in it was sparked by my desire to learn to make games. Though I'm just a beginner now and I have a lot to learn. I've been learning a lot about HTML and CSS to make this webpage, but I started learning the basics of programming in Java before moving on to C# as part of the Computer Science program at my college. There's so much I have to learn, but I'm glad to have gotten started, because I've got a long road ahead of me.</p>
